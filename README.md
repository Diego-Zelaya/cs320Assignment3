Diego Zelaya:  Prog3_1.c - Prog3_7.c                --SUMMARY--  

Prog3_1.cpp:     My program passes only one argument, creating the new LUA state which is needed to interlink with Python, opens the library function

Prog3_2.lua:     
My program includes an assignment header,Created funtions to search for items on the list, then function gets the table length, it then list
the operands to search and compare with leftAssociative and Precedince having priotiryt and declaring order within the program so that the distributive property
is executed on run. Then the prgram splits the string and loops for all the prompted input. Then infix to postfix is printed.

Prog3_3.cpp:     My program includes an header Assignement, prog3_2.lua, and prog3_3.cpp. Creates an character array for loop checks 
and creates array for InputLoop. Checks for INT, STR, TokenStrin loc, push, pop, print. Pushes it into the stacklist. Call to print 
Loop for recursion Stack so it could print from bottom to top. As it was shown via pdf file. If errors occurence is true, as in Assignment1, 
the the program will print an ERROR message, effectively leting the user know they made a mistake, and when the occurence is not true and 
the user inputs two tokens the program will state if the token is a string and int, then exit. 


Prog3_7:    'Extra Credt' User program what we learned to in C/C++ and Lua intergration to solve basic arithmetic problems. User will input a set of math 
character folowed by two numbers and it should create a solution float was not needed according to the example in the class pdf..md
