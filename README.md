Diego Zelaya  Prog3_1.c - Prog3_7.c                --SUMMARY--  

Prog3_1.cpp:     My program implents and passes an array, into a character and then funnel out the print via cout, 
more or less than one command line print error, arg command argument should be of integer N, quit will terminate 
the program, runs more or less like prog5 of Assignment1  

Prog3_2.cpp:     My program includes an assignment header, also implements Tokenizer.hpp, creates a global  int for OnlyPassOneArg, 
Argv1mustBeInt, InputLoop.  Program ask the user for a '>' so they can input a string, when the user types in something it will be 
treated as a one string line and enter will force terminate with adding wheather the. The use of strtok will then split the string 
into tokens. While loop for tokens will be intialized to tokens and these tokens whil have a definition of String or Integer.  
At post 65 character used however I used 66. The out put will run to the stdout and then terminated program.  

Prog3_3.lua:     My program includes an header Assignement, Stack.hpp, and Tokenizer.hpp. Creates an character array for loop checks 
and creates array for InputLoop. Checks for INT, STR, TokenStrin loc, push, pop, print. Pushes it into the stacklist. Call to print 
Loop for recursion Stack so it could print from bottom to top. As it was shown via pdf file. If errors occurence is true, as in Assignment1, 
the the program will print an ERROR message, effectively leting the user know they made a mistake, and when the occurence is not true and 
the user inputs two tokens the program will state if the token is a string and int, then exit. 


Prog3_7:     User program what we learned to in C/C++ and Lua intergration to solve basic arithmetic problems. User will input a set of math 
character folowed by two numbers and it should create a solution float was not needed according to the example in the class pdf..md
